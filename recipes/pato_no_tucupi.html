        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The dish features <strong>duck</strong>(pato) cooked in <strong>tucupi</strong>, a yellow broth made from the juice
            of wild manioc (mandioca). Another key ingredient is jambu, a native herb that has a slightly numbing effect on the
            mouth, adding an interesting sensory experience to the dish.</p>
        <p>Pato no tucupi is often served with white rice and farinha (manioc flour). It's especially popular during the Círio
            de Nazaré, a major religious festival in Pará.</p>
