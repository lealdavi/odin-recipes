        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Maniçoba</em> is a hearty and traditional dish from Pará, Brazil. Often called "the feijoada of the Amazon",
            it is made from the leaves of the manioc plant, which are boiled for several days to remove toxins. The leaves
            are then combined with various types of pork and sausage, creating a rich and flavorful stew. It's a staple
            during the Círio de Nazaré festival, a major cultural and religious event in Belém.</p>
